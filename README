Geopost
=======

Geocode postcodes using Emad Fanous's localsearchmaps.com api.

Precisely geocodes full UK postocdes, falling back a comprehensive local
list of primary postcode areas.

Results are cached in lib/geocoded. I'll merge cache files from forked
repos to speed up queries and reduce the burden on Emad's server.

Example
=======

Geopost.new("EC2A 3JL")

Geopost.new(90210, :us)

Where 'bar' object has postcode attribute and writable lat and lng
attributes:

Geopost.new(bar)
