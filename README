Geopost
=======

Geocode postcodes using Emad Fanous's localsearchmaps.com api.

Precisely geocodes full UK postocdes, falling back to a comprehensive
local list of primary postcode areas.

Results are cached in lib/geocoded. I'll merge cache files from forked
repos to speed up queries and reduce the burden on Emad's server.

Example
=======

Geo::Post.new("EC2A 3JL")

Geo::Post.new(90210, :us)

Where 'bar' object has postcode attribute and writable lat and lng
attributes:

Geo::Post.new(bar)

Actual driving distance and travel time between two postcodes:

Loading development environment (Rails 2.0.2)
>> Geo::Drive.new("sw19", "l37 !  2hn")
"RECEIVED 25025 CHUNK"
"Got A BLANK chunk line"
=> #<Geo::Drive:0xb70cf99c @miles=233.0, @from="SW19", @minutes=10, @hours=4, @to="L37+2HN">

Passed postcodes filtered through Geo:Post for error correction.
